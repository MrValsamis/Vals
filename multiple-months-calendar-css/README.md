Event calendar built with Flatpickr.

Although Flatpickr is intended for date selection of dates on an input element, by creating it manually and inserting the HTML it can make a very nice calendar. Usefully handles date formatting and such naturally, and could also obviously be very easily connected to an input if needed.
