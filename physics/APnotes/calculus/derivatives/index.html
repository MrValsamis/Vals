This lesson is a brief explanation of how calculus (the derivative) is used in physics. It is not meant to replace the rigorous investigation you will be undertaking in your mathematics classes. It is just something we can put in place so we can get started looking at natural phenomena in ways that more closely represent real situations.</p>

<h1 class='underlined' id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The notion of calculus being used in physics goes back to the days of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz, the inventors of the calculus. Newton is given the credit, although both he and Leibnitz came up with the fundamental ideas about the same time.</p>

<p>
So why calculus? We’ve already seen how we can solve position, velocity, and acceleration problems with conventional algebra. Why do we need to create more difficulty for ourselves? If you recall, the problems we dealt with in the past all assumed that something was constant – constant v, constant a, constant whatever. What if things aren’t constant? What if, for example, a force acting on an object depends on the velocity of that object? This happens when we consider air resistance, a factor we conveniently swept under the rug in our previous classes.</p>




<h1 class='underlined' id="differentiation">Differentiation</h1>
<p>If we consider the motion of a particle as represented by the graph below, we understand that the particle is constantly moving farther and farther from the origin. Because the graph is linear, we can infer that the speed at which the particle is moving is constant. We know from our previous classes that the slope of the x vs t graph is the velocity of the particle. If we take the slope of this graph, we find that it is a constant, supporting our earlier inference.</p>


			<svg class='center' id="SVG-graph-0" viewBox="0 0 600 290" title="title"> </svg>
			<script defer>
				funGraphSVG("SVG-graph-0", x => 1/2*x , {
					x0: 15,
					y0: 270,
					stroke: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 1)",
					fill: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 0.15)",
					positiveOnly: true,
					step: 10,
					scale: 50,
					gridSize: 50,
					strokeWidth: 3,
					xLabel: "time (s)",
					yLabel: "position (m)",
					showMouseCoords: true,
				});
			</script>
 <p>In the case above, the speed of the particle is the same anywhere in time. The instantaneous speed is about 0.50 m/s and is the same for any value of t. We know that because the change in position (the y-axis) divided by the change in time (the x-axis) is the same anywhere we look.</p>

<p>When considering the equation for a straight line, the familiar formula is</p>

<div class='definition'>
$$y = mx + b$$
</div>
where m is the slope of the line, or
<div class='definition'>
$$m = \frac{Δy}{Δx} = \frac{y_2 − y_1}{x_2 − x_1}$$
</div>

<p>Notice that it doesn’t matter where we choose to pick \(x_1, x_2, y_1, \text{or } y_2\) simply because the
line has the same slope everywhere.</p>



<p>Now, what if we have a particle with a graph that looks more like the curve in the illustration below? Clearly, the slope of that line is not constant. For any points (\(x_1\), \(y_1\)) and (\(x_2\), \(y_2\)), the slope of the line, which is just the tangent to the line at that point, will be different. If this is a displacement/time graph where the slope of the line represents the speed of the particle, the instantaneous speed of this particle will not be constant.</p>

<svg class='center' id="SVG-graph-1" viewBox="0 0 600 290" title="title"> </svg>
			<script defer>
				funGraphSVG3("SVG-graph-1", x => (1/20)*x*x , {
					x0: 15,
					y0: 270,
					stroke: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 1)",
					fill: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 0.15)",
					positiveOnly: true,
					step: 10,
					scale: 50,
					gridSize: 50,
					strokeWidth: 3,
					xLabel: "time (s)",
					yLabel: "position (m)",
					showMouseCoords: true,
				});
			</script>


<p>So, what is the instantaneous slope at some point (x,y)?</p>

<p>Visualize this: pick a point (\(x\),\(y\)) and a neighboring point close by at <br> (\(x+∆x\), \(y+∆y\)), and compute the slope of the line through those points, as illustrated below.</p>

<svg class='center' id="SVG-graph-2" viewBox="0 0 600 290" title="title"> </svg>
			<script defer>
				funGraphSVG4("SVG-graph-2", x => (1/20)*x*x , {
					x0: 15,
					y0: 270,
					stroke: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 1)",
					fill: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 0.15)",
					positiveOnly: true,
					step: 10,
					scale: 50,
					gridSize: 50,
					strokeWidth: 3,
					xLabel: "time (s)",
					yLabel: "position (m)",
					showMouseCoords: true,
				});
			</script>

<p>The slope is given by:</p>

<div class='definition'>
$$m = \frac {(y+Δy)-y}{(x+Δx)-x} = \frac{Δy}{Δx}$$
</div>

<p>Now, let's let \(Δx\) get smaller.  So small, in fact, that it approaches zero.  This is called taking the limit of \(Δx\) and is designated mathematically as</p>

<div class='definition'>
$$\lim_{Δx \to 0}Δx= dx$$
</div>

<p>where \(dx\) represents the limit operation as applied to variable \(x\).</p>

<p>Because \(y\) is a function of \(x\), that is, \(y=f(x)\), \(y\) at some point \(x+∆x\) is just \(y=f(x+∆x)\). The slope of the tangent of the line at point (\(x\),\(y\)) is</p>

<div class='definition'>
$$\text{slope of the tangent }= \lim_{Δx \to 0}\frac{f(x+Δx)-f(x)}{Δx}$$
</div>

<svg class='center' id="SVG-graph-4" viewBox="0 0 600 290" title="title"> </svg>
			<script defer>
				funGraphSVG5("SVG-graph-4", x => (1/20)*x*x , {
					x0: 15,
					y0: 270,
					stroke: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 1)",
					fill: "rgba(20, 200, 255, 0.15)",
					positiveOnly: true,
					step: 10,
					scale: 50,
					gridSize: 50,
					strokeWidth: 3,
					xLabel: "time (s)",
					yLabel: "position (m)",
					showMouseCoords: true,
				});
			</script>

<p>This can be rewritten symbolically as</p>

<div class='definition'>
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{Δx \to 0}\frac{f(x+Δx)-f(x)}{Δx}$$
</div>
